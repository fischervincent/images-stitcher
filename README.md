# Images Stitcher
The idea is to have a webapp that allows me to upload images that partially overlap to stitch them.
Can be usefull when you can not screenshot everything you need, but parts of it.

It is written in plain html and javascript mainly by chat gpt because I had no idea how to do it fast with very few features.

It does not support rotation or scaling.

After uploading images, it will displays the images with marks on it to indicate where it found matches features on the images, and also a canvas of all the images that are stitched together. And there is a button to download the stitched image.
